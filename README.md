# Stock-Market-Detailing-Application
In this project, I have worked on Spring Boot microservices along with MongoDB Atlas as backend and Angular.js as frontend to design a Stock Market Detailing Application.

# Microservices : 

1.Company Service: Manages information related to companies, including details such as name, industry, location, and financial data.

2.Sector Service: Provides information about different sectors of the economy, categorizing companies based on their industry and business activities.

3.Stock Exchange Service: Facilitates trading activities by providing access to stock exchange data, including lists of listed companies, trading volumes, and market trends.

4.Stock Price Service: Offers real-time and historical data on stock prices, allowing users to track the performance of individual stocks or entire portfolios.
